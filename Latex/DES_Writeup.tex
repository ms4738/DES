\section{Individual Contributions}
Team members did most of the work together. Pair programming was implemented
in the beginning to code individual modules. Matt and Monica worked together in
one pair, and George and Brandon in another. These modules were then placed in
the main file accordingly. Once debugging started, it became
a whole team effort with everybody analyzing the output. To verify that our
encryption was working correctly,
George took it upon himself to run through the algorithm by hand. He worked with
a very simple key and plaintext. This process was compared to the output of the
bit strings that our program output before and after steps in the algorithm.
This processes verified that our encryption was accurate, and we were able to
continue debugging to completion as a team. Brandon drafted up the latex
document, and George created the graphs.
